# Personalized Meal Planner

A system that helps users plan meals based on dietary preferences, nutritional requirements, and available ingredients. Due to insufficient funds, the AI agents can be slow sometimes. üò¢

## üîç Project Overview

This project utilizes a team of AI agents to generate personalized meal plans collaboratively. The agents use the LangGraph framework and Tavily API to achieve their goals.

[LangGraph Library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)

## Agents

1. **Meal Planner Agent**: Responsible for creating an initial meal plan outline based on the user's task description.
2. **Meal Plan Generator Agent**: Generates a detailed meal plan based on the initial outline and the gathered research content.
3. **Reflect Meal Plan Agent**: Generates a list of search queries to gather additional information needed to make any requested revisions based on the critique.
4. **Meal Plan Researcher Agent**: Generates a list of search queries to gather relevant information (such as calories, protein, ingredients, and recipes) needed to create a detailed meal plan. Researches Meal plan based on generated search query.
5. **Meal Plan Critique Agent**: Reviews the detailed meal plan draft and provides critique and recommendations for improvement.
